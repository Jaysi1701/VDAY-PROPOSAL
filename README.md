If they press the first button it means that they agree to go out with you.The led matrix will start working and print a beautiful heart pattern as a symbol of acceptence along with a message for them on the lcd screen.

If they press the second button it means that they do not want to go out with you.In that case the led matrix lights up and displays a smiley face which turns sad followed by a rejection message on the lcd screen.
